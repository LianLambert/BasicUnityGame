Hello!

Thanks for grading my project. I tried opening the zip file and all the assets looked good and the scripts were attached to the right objects so hopefully it all goes smoothly for you!

Here is the list of assets I used, they are also in the file "Unity Assets" :

Farland Skies - Cloudy Crown
LowPoly Guns - 3D Guns Pack
Poly Ninja - Free Hand Painted Rocks 'N' Boulders
Pure Poly - Free Low Poly Nature Forest
